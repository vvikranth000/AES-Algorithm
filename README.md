The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)



In this module we have the python code.

we requried few requerements before runing the code

1)install python 3.5+(from the https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2)install python modules(pip install pycryptodome)

3)After this run the file AES-Algorithm.py 

4)After it ask want to (E)encryption or (D)decryption if u want to encryption press E and if u want to decryption press D

5)enter the file location for your file

6)enter the password to encryption (plz note with the same encryption key we can decryption) then u have successfully encryption the file.

7)if u want to decrypt then press D and enter the file location u want to decrypt
